## Overview

GRAMI-AI is a cutting-edge, async-first AI agent framework designed to solve complex computational challenges through intelligent, collaborative agent interactions. Built with unprecedented flexibility, this library empowers developers to create sophisticated, context-aware AI systems that can adapt, learn, and collaborate across diverse domains.

## Key Features

- **Async-First Architecture**: Designed for high-performance, non-blocking operations
- **Multi-Modal Agent Interactions**: Seamless collaboration between specialized AI agents
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for multiple language models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Dynamic Tool Ecosystem**: Easily extensible with custom tools and capabilities
- **Context-Aware Agents**: Intelligent agents that maintain and leverage conversation context

## Installation

```bash
pip install grami-ai
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from grami.agent import Agent
from grami.providers import GeminiProvider
from grami.tools import CalculatorTool

async def main():
    # Create an intelligent math agent
    math_agent = Agent(
        name="MathTutor",
        role="Mathematical Problem Solver",
        llm_provider=GeminiProvider(api_key="your_api_key"),
        tools=[CalculatorTool()],
        initial_context=[
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": "You are a helpful math assistant who explains solutions step by step."
            }
        ]
    )

    # Solve a mathematical problem
    response = await math_agent.send_message(
        "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 and explain your reasoning"
    )
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```
